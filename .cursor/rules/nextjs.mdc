- Make a plan is the index page - show a draft plan if there is one - query draftMoneyPlan to see if there's a money plan. If not, show an empty state.
- View plans (/plans) shows the overview of all plans (draft if there is one and show all by querying moneyPlans) - be sure to paginate.
- Place as much frontend logic as possible in hooks to make the code more testable.
