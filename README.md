# A Money Plan
This spin on budgeting is essentially zero-based budgeting except that I use it to disperse funds. The way
I've been able to get myself to manage my finances is by budgeting. I do not track every expense (I know,
I'm a heretic). Of course, for my budgeting to work, I have a good idea of how much I spend and what my fixed expenses
are.

By using many accounts, I've created a digital version of the envelope system. I used the cash envelope system for a
while, but it's annoying because you have to go to an ATM to get cash. Then you have to remember to carry all your
envelopes wherever you go. And I don't like paying in cash, it's tedious.

This plan assumes that you have a checking account where you receive direct deposits. From this account, you disperse
funds to other accounts, to savings/investments, etc. You also ought to use this account to pay cards and other living
expenses.

The checking account where I receive direct deposits is not for day-to-day stuff (groceries, gas, clothes, etc).
I have a separate checking account with its own debit card that I use to pay for groceries, eating out, clothing,
hair cuts, etc. I personally opened an account in a separate bank to keep day-to-day expenses separate from funds used
to pay for housing, utilities, insurance, etc.

## Sample Money Plan
Each money plan corresponds to a paycheck. The day I get paid, I create a money plan to immediately move the money to
all the corresponding accounts (gotta put money to work). I get paid twice a month, so I create two money plans each
month.

In this example, the Starting Balance represents the balance of Bank Abc's Checking Account after getting paid.

| Account           | Category            | Amount |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Starting Balance  | Bank Abc            | 5000   |
|                   |                     |        |
| Bank Abc          | Rent                | (1400) |
|                   | Utilities           | (650)  |
|                   | Cell Bill           | (150)  |
|                   |                     |        |
| Investment Bank A | General Investing   | (800)  |
|                   |                     |        |
| Investment Bank B | IRA                 | (200)  |
|                   |                     |        |
| Bank XYZ          | Checking            | (600)  |
|                   | Emergency Fund      | (100)  |
|                   | Car Repairs Savings | (100)  |
|                   |                     |        |
| Credit Card A     | Gas                 | (200)  |
|                   | Splurge             | (300)  |
|                   | Groceries           | (400)  |
|                   | Subscriptions       | (100)  |
|                   |                     |        |
|                   |                     | 0      |

Notice that in this sample plan, the funds to pay rent, utilities, and the cell bill are left in Bank Abc. The rest of
the funds are dispersed to the other accounts. Bank XYZ is used for day-to-day expenses and emergency savings.
