# A Money Plan
This spin on budgeting is essentially zero-based budgeting except that I use it primarily to disperse funds. The way
I've been able to get myself to manage my finances is by only budgeting. I do not track every expense (I know,
I'm a heretic). Of course, for my budgeting to work, I have a good idea of how much I spend and what my fixed expenses
are.

By using many accounts, I've created a digital version of the envelope system. I used the cash envelope system for a
while, but it's annoying because you have to go to an ATM to get cash then you have to remember to carry all your
envelopes wherever you go. And I don't like paying in cash, it's tedious.

This plan assumes that you have a checking account where you receive direct deposits. From this account, you disperse
funds to other accounts, to savings/investments, and expenses.

Do not use this checking account to pay for day-to-day stuff (groceries, gas, clothes, etc). Open a separate checking
account with a debit card that you'll use to pay for groceries, eating out, clothing, hair cuts, etc. I personally
opened an account in a separate bank.

## Sample Money Plan
Each money plan correlates to a paycheck. The day I get paid, I create a money plan to immediately move money to all
accounts (gotta put money to work). I get paid twice a month, so I create two money plans each month.

In this example, the debit represents the starting balance of Bank A after getting paid.

|              |                   |                     |        |
| Credit       | Investment Bank A | General Investing   | (250)  |

|              |                   | Car Repairs Savings | (100)  |
|              |                   |                     |        |
| Credit       | Credit Card A     | Gas                 | (100)  |

|              |                   |                     |        |
|              |                   |                     | 0      |
